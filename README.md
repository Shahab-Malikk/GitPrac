# Practice Project

It's just a practice project to practice git commands and for better understanding of git and how it's works



## How it will work

For this one you have to create your own branch naming convention will be jsPrac/your_intials and you have to push the code on your specific branch


## Steps

Following are the steps you have to follow 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shahab-Malikk/GitPrac.git
  cd GitPrac
  git checkout jsPrac
  git checkout -b YOUR_INTIALS/jsPrac jsPrac
  ```

After creating and switching to your new branch you will create a folder by your name and then will add your code files in that folder. After writing code or when you want to push code to git follow these commands



```bash
 git add .
 git commit -m "Test commit"
 git push -u origin your_branch_name
  ```
 You will add name of your branch.

 After that create a pull request by going on github 

 Happy Hacking :)
